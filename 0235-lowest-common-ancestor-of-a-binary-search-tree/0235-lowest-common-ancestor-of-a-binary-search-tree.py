#Time Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the BST (O(log n) for balanced, O(n) for skewed tree).
#Space Complexity: O(1) for the iterative approach (no recursion stack).

#Dry Run:
#[6, 2, 8, 0, 4, 7, 9, null, null, 3, 5] p = 2, q = 8 LCA = 6
# curr = 6, 2<6 yes and 8< 6 no return curr = 6

#[6, 2, 8, 0, 4, 7, 9, null, null, 3, 5] p = 2, q = 4 LCA = ?
# curr = 6, 2< 6 yes, 4< yes curr.left = 2
# curr = 2, 2< 6 no, return curr, 2

#Clarifying Questions:
# will p and q guaranteed to exist in the BST ? yes
# Are all node values unique 
#Can p and q be root ? 
#is the tree guaranteed to be a BST ? 
# will p be equal to q
#Should i return the node itself or just the value? 
#Can p and q be direct parent/ child? yes
#what if p is the ancestor of q or vise versa? 

# [6, 2, 8, 0, 4, 7, 9, null, null, 3, 5] p = 2, q = 8 LCA = 6
# p = 2, q = 4 LCA = 2

#Approach (Think out loud):
#Because this is a BST, all left descendants are < root and all right are >.
#So, if both p and q are < root, LCA is in the left subtree.
#If both > root, itâ€™s in the right subtree.
#Otherwise, root is the split point, and hence the LCA.
