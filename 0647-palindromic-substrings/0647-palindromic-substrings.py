        --- Implementation Steps ---
        1. Initialize a result counter (res) to 0.
        2. For each index in s:
            a. Expand outwards from s[i] for odd-length palindromes.
            b. Expand outwards from between s[i] and s[i+1] for even-length palindromes.
            c. Every time the substring is a palindrome, increment res.
        3. Return res as the number of palindromic substrings.

        --- Dry Run ---
        s = "aaa"
        i = 0: Odd: "a" (res=1), Even: "aa" (res=2)
        i = 1: Odd: "a" (res=3), Expand: "aaa" (res=4), Even: "aa" (res=5)
        i = 2: Odd: "a" (res=6)
        Total: 6 palindromic substrings

        --- Time Complexity ---
        O(nÂ²), since for each center you may expand up to n times.

        --- Space Complexity ---
        O(1), just counters and loop variables.

        --- Interview Guidance ---
        - "I'm using expand-around-center to check every possible palindrome."
        - "For each position (and each gap), I grow outwards, and count palindromes."
        - "Single letters, two letters, and longer substrings are all handled."
